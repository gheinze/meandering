This same bit of code has gone through a number of iterations: ported from Java to Javascript, embedded as part of browser plugins, etc. Primarily it is a practical tool for me. I found many online amortization calculators to be less reliable: home mortgages are amortized semi-annually in Canada. Car loans are typically amortized monthly. Sometimes overpayments are made, etc.

But this is also a nice demonstration of Javascript in the browser: the ability to have a serverless, static page to run some code on any machine that has a browser. That is really nice.
