Puzzled over this one for a bit. Some sleuthing by others started putting the pieces together (I think).

* this photo was taken in Shingu, a coastal city in Wakayama prefecture, Japan
* web searching finds a fishing store in Wakayama: http://dreem-up.com/
* image searching "dreem up" will show some artificial worms for fishing
* 最高の [Saikō no] is Japanese for "the greatest", "the best", ... or ... "the highest"

And with that, we retreat from the edge of chaos.
